Main lists/variables/constants:

    matrix: 2D list to store the letter matrix from the text file.
    matrixF: The text file to read the matrix from.
    steps: 1D list to store the steps from the steps file.
    stepF: The steps file to read the steps from.
    fLetterPos: 1D list to store the positions of the first letters in the matrix.
    firstLetters: String to store the given input letters.

----------------------------------------------------------------
Main algorithm steps:
    2.1. Read the letter matrix from the text file and store it in 'matrix'.
    2.2. Read the steps from the steps file and store them in 'steps'.
    2.3. Find the positions of the first letters in the matrix and store them in 'fLetterPos'.
    2.4. Check if the first letters are found in the matrix.
    2.5. If found, loop through the positions of the first letters and create a message starting with the first letter.
    2.6. Loop through the steps, calculate the next position and letter, and add the next letter to the message.
    2.7. If the message starts with the given first letters, return the message as the secret word.
    2.8. If the secret word is not found, return an error message.

Additional considerations:
    Wrapping around edges: Use modulo operation to wrap around the edges of the matrix when calculating the next position.
    Work with any length input string and any test case, including those with multiple paths.

High-level pseudo-code:
    Define the findMessage class.
        1.1. Initialize the class with textF, stepsF, and letters.
        1.2. Read the letter matrix from the text file.
        1.3. Read the steps from the steps file.
        1.4. Find the positions of the first letters in the matrix.
    Define a method to find the combination of letters.
        2.1. Loop through the positions of the first letters.
        2.2. Create a message starting with the first letter.
        2.3. Loop through the steps, calculating the next position and letter.
        2.4. Add the next letter to the message.
        2.5. If the message starts with the given letters, return the message.
    Define a method to extract the secret message.
        3.1. Check if the first letters are found.
        3.2. If found, call the method to find the combination.
        3.3. If not found, return an error message.

    Instantiate the findMessage class with the required parameters.
    Call the extract_message method to find and display the secret message.
    With this plan, a third party should be able to follow the entire process of message extraction. The final submission will include the updated plan and the Python code.
